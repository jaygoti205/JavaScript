                        <p> Bridgerton returned, and so did the lady who knows everything, Lady Whistledown. (Yes, we
                            know we are a little late to the party, but it is no biggie). This time she is back with her
                            historical K-beauty journals to spill the beans on your favourite Netflix characters‚Äô
                            K-Beauty secrets, so brace yourself to know the deets ü§´.</p>
                        <p> If you're into skincare trends, you know it's almost hard to overlook the fact that Korean
                            Beauty (also known as K-Beauty) is incredibly effective and is now ruling the business.</p>
                        <p>Koreans have without a doubt the most promising skincare regimen, and K Beauty is even
                            featured in some of the most popular Netflix series. These items are based on the Korean
                            beauty concept, which emphasises consistency and commitment. Well, in our opinion, what
                            separates these products from beauty products all around the world is that they stay for the
                            long haul.</p>
